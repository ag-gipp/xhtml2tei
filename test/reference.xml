        The NIST Digital Repository of Mathematical Formulae [] is an online compendium of mathematical formulae data for orthogonal polynomial and special functions.
  The initial formula data was obtained from the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions [].
  DLMF uses semantic macros [], which are converted by \LaTeXML [] to parallel markup including content \MathML.
  We refer to the symbols generated by \LaTeXML as implicit content dictionaries [].
  However, the DRMF does not only contain formula-data from the DLMF.
  In 2015, we started to extend our library with sources that do not use the DLMF macro schema [].
  In this process, we introduced new symbols and associated LaTeX macros.
  In this content dictionary, we are release an initial version of the symbols introduced while processing Chapter 9 of the KLS dataset [].
  Currently, we are extending our work on Mathematical Language Processing [].
  A content dictionary is beneficial for this task, since is specifies the semantics in an standard conforming way.
      </p><head>2Symbol Naming Conventions</head><p>
        We use the same Naming convention for LaTeX macro names and the content dictionary symbols.
  The symbols follow simple naming conventions that we will discuss in this section.
  The goal for our naming convention is to have short, memorialize and unambiguous names.
  Currently, the DRMF website uses 689 custom LaTeX macros.
  Their length varies between 1 and 26 characters and the median length is 8 characters.
  The name is derived from a short symbol description using the following conventions:
        
          
            concatination
            
              Individual elements are concatenated without spaces.
  Camel case is not used.
            
          
          
            capitalization
            
              Individual’s names are capitalized.
  Mathematical identifiers such as 
                  
                    q
                  
                 and standard macros such as 
                  
                    
                      
                        
                        
                        
                      
                      
                        log
                        ,
                        Log
                      
                    
                  
                 are used as normal capitalization.
  Properties such as continuous, monic, generalized, normalized are written in lower case.
            
          
          
            abbreivations
            
              Only a limited set of abbreviations is used. See Table .
            
          
        
      </p><head>3New Symbols</head><p>
        Extensibility is one of the key gols of the DRMF project.
  Consequently, we developed a mechanism to update our custom macros or add new macros.
  Adding a macro follows this proceducre:
        
          
            1.
            
              Identify a symbol and its definition in the literature.
            
          
          
            2.
            
              Describe the symbol with a short name but without ambiguities.
  This description can include properties, individuals names (cf. Section ) as well as presentational features.
            
          
          
            3.
            
              Derive the symbol name based on the description:
              
                
                  –
                  
                    Remove whitespaces.
                  
                
                
                  –
                  
                    Replace presentational features with their verbalization, e.g., $\tilde p$ 
                        
                          ↦
                        
                       ptilde.
                  
                
                
                  –
                  
                    Replace abbreviations.
                  
                
                
                  –
                  
                    Remove superflous words like “polynomial”. (Our convention to
  to drop the word “polynomial” for this dataset is because these are the
  most abundant objects.)
                  
                
              
            
          
          
            4.
            
              Add a definition or a longer description of the symbol.
            
          
          
            5.
            
              Add references to the literature.
            
          
          
            6.
            
              Update the DRMF LaTeX style file locally and define calling sequences.
  That is, the different numbers of parameters which can be used for the same macro name.
  For example the macro normWilsonWtilde can be called with 5 or with only one parameters/arguments.
            
          
          
            7.
            
              Update the Macro definitions for the DRMF \LaTeXML server.
            
          
          
            8.
            
              Add a Wikipage in the namespace “Definition” with the name of the symbol that:
              
                
                  –
                  
                    describes the calling sequences;
                  
                
                
                  –
                  
                    lists the definition;
                  
                
                
                  –
                  
                    shows the rendering;
                  
                
                
                  –
                  
                    gives references to the literature; and
                  
                
                
                  –
                  
                    lists the definition.
                  
                
              
            
          
          
            9.
            
              Link the new wikipage on the symbol definition overview.
            
          
        
        To rename a symbol, the DRMF style file has to be adjusted and to be uploaded again to the server.
  The definition page has to be moved manually. In contrast, all occourences of the macro can be replaced using the search
  and replace MediaWiki plugin. This will trigger automated updates for the MathSearch index [].

        Currently, the content dictionary is a proof of concept.
  For the future, we are planning to automate the creation of content dictionaries for other chapters and sources.
  Chapter 14 of KLS is already in preparation.
